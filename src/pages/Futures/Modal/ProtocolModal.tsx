          1. Uncertainty risk of income: The calculation method of NEST
          perpetual contract is different from the calculation method of
          perpetual contract of traditional centralized exchange. The NEST
          perpetual contract converts the future price of the asset based on the
          historical rate of return of the asset. Therefore, the asset price
          increases by 100% after the user opens a position. The user's income
          is not 100%. In extreme cases, even if the asset price is rising, your
          income may be negative.
        </Trans>
      </p>
      <p>
        <Trans>
          2. Position liquidation risk: NEST perpetual contracts provide
          leverage of 1-20 times. When your leverage is greater than 1 times
          leverage, the price fluctuation of the underlying asset may cause
          liquidation.

        <Trans>
          3. NEST Token price fluctuation risk: Both the margin and the final
          profit and loss use NEST Token, and NEST itself is also a highly
          volatile asset. In extreme cases, even if your perpetual contract
          position is profitable, However, due to the fluctuation of the NEST
          price itself, it may cause you to lose money in terms of fiat
          currency.
        </Trans>
      </p>
      <p>
        <Trans>
          4. External oracle risk: NEST protocol's perpetual contract price
          comes from the NEST oracle. If the oracle is attacked or other reasons
          cause the price to be abnormal, The system may encounter settlement
          exceptions, which may cause errors in the user's revenue calculation.
        </Trans>

      <p>
        <Trans>
          5. Smart contract risk: There may be fatal unknown risks in the smart
          contract that may cause your principal to be damaged. Please evaluate
          the risk yourself before deciding whether to participate.
